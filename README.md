# Collaborative AR/VR Learning Platform

## What is it?
Maintaining student attention and focus is one of the main challenges of STEM education, especially when dealing with abstract concepts or systems invisible to the naked eye. While traditional teaching methods have undeniable value, they meet their natural limits when faced with these invisible barriers between knowledge and true understanding.

After all, **how does one effectively explain the movement of electrons, or the inner workings of an electrical circuit using only analogies or flat diagrams on a board**? Something essential is missing: the ability to touch and experience these ideas in three dimensions.

These missing elements are exactly what **Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies can bring**. With them, students can hold a molecule in their hands, directly visualize current flow in circuit boards, or even safely conduct experiments that would otherwise be too dangerous in conventional classrooms.

However, despite clear potential, these technologies remain far from everyday reality in many sectors. One of the main reasons for this is the technological fragmentation. The mixed reality landscape suffers from a fundamental interoperability problem, as existing devices and platforms often operate in isolation, or are locked to specific systems. This means that to support different AR and VR technologies developers are often forced to create and maintain separate versions of the same application – a costly and inefficient approach that severely limits scalability.

This is not just a technical inconvenience, as it hinders scaling and widespread adoption. Depending on the hardware they use, participants in the same digital experience end up having fundamentally different capabilities: some may lack key features, others may even be unable to participate at all. The experience becomes fragmented rather than truly shared.

With this in mind, **this project aims to address these challenges by developing an open-source, cross-device mixed reality platform**. One that unites users in shared virtual environments - regardless of their hardware or physical location - and enables true, real-time collaboration.
